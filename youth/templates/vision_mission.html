                  <h3>MISSION</h3>
                  
                  <p>To provide catalytic leadership, breakthrough knowledge, and innovative resources to advance the health of children, youth, families, and communities</p>
                  <h4>We Believe . . .</h4>
                  <p>All YOUTHS need and deserve the range of “developmental nutrients” identified in the framework of Developmental Assets.

                    “All YOUTHS” includes youths of all races, ethnicities, cultures, genders, religions, economic backgrounds, sexual orientations, gender identities, and abilities.
                    
                    Significant community and societal change is needed to ensure the equitable spread of Developmental Assets; the five action strategies we have identified can bring about this change.
                    
                    All communities have the talent, wisdom, and expertise to create thriving communities.
                    
                    Developmental Assets have many sources, including adult influence, peer influence, families, neighborhoods, congregations, schools, and youth organizations.
                    
                    These resources, individually and in combination, can be powerfully mobilized at the local, community level.
                    
                    The community and social change needed to reach our vision requires major transformation of how we see, know, and relate with YOUTHS.
                    
                    YOUTHS are particularly powerful agents of change and should be positioned as leaders in transforming community and society.
                    
                    The prime actors in this transformation are all people: children, adolescents, and adults.
                    
                    Search Institute’s role is to provide knowledge and resources to help them create an environment that supports young people.

We authentically share with the field the roles of experts, leaders, and learners, and seek collaboration with internal and external groups. We intentionally seek to engage collaborators from across political, ideological, religious, cultural, and other differences, believing that active engagement with others—even when we do not agree on important issues—is critical for creating a sense of the common good and for working for positive community and social change.</p>
