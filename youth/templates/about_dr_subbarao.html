      <div class="pb-md-5 pb-4">
                    <p>Mahatma Gandhi still lives through the lives of many dedicated soldiers of peace, such as one of the most popular and dynamic youth leader, Dr. S.N. Subba Rao, a fellow of Gandhi Peace Foundation and founder of National Youth Project. He inspires and lifts up the spirit of youth in the world for building a new society based on Love, Peace, Harmony and Social Justice.

                        Every one affectionately calls him ‘Bhai Ji,’ meaning ‘Elder Brother’ and he reciprocates their love with equal abandon. That is why a personal bond is quickly formed between him and any one who meets him.</p>
                    <h6 class="mb-4">EARLY LIFE</h6>
                    <p>Shri Salem Nanjundaiah Subba Rao was born in Bangalore, Karnataka, on 7th Feb. 1929. His father Shri Nanjudaiah was an advocate of repute, known for refusing unjust cases. Along with his three brothers, Subba Rao started singing devotional songs at the tender age of ten in the Ramakrishna Vedanta College, Malleshwaram. While studying in the school he was inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
                    <h6 class="mb-4">MAHATMA GANDHI SEWA ASHRAM</h6> 
                    <p>When in 1954, Shri Subba Rao walked through the terrains of Chambal, he had realized the importance of constructive educational module for the youth of Chambal. It was this concept, which contributed to the organization of “ Shram Camps” in the region. Shri Subba Rao organized a record 10 month long camp at Joura, a town in Chambal valley, in 1964, with the participation of young men and women from all parts of the country. Therefore in 1970, when he thought of serving the whole country rather than one political party. Shri Subba Rao with the money he got as honourarium for working as Director of ‘Gandhi Darshan Train’, founded Mahatma Gandhi Sewa Ashram in Chambal valley at Joura, district Morena (Madhya Pradesh), on September 27. It was this Ashram, which later on hosted the historic surrender of the most notorious dacoits like Mohar Singh, Madho Singh and others on 14th April, 1972. These efforts were followed by the surrender of dacoits at Bateshwar (U.P.) and Talabshahi (Rajesthan). The Ashram worked for rehabilitation of these dacoits‘ families and the families of their victims alike.</p>

              <p>
As in many other countries, thousands of youths came out with dedication and sacrifice to join the struggle for freedom and the motivating force then was to free their country from foreign rule. The motivating force for the youths now to join the movement should be to free their country from shortcomings. Activities that will help build the ‘espirit-de-corps’ among the youths include community work for the benefit of the needy, all religious prayers and learning each other’s language for national integration. Youths will have other activities devoted to the process of making a family of youths belonging to all religions, regions, languages and political thinking.
The movement launched under the directorship of Dr. S.N. Subba Rao was named National Youth Project (NYP)
N.Y.P. organised youth camps and other programmes in many parts/cities of India such as Nagaland , Manipur, Sikkim, Ladakh, Lakshdweep, Andaman, Bhagalpur, Aligarh, Bombay, Godhra, Kanpur, Nakodar and other riot affected places. Padyatras by these youths in the affected areas are found most helpful in bridging the gulf between people.
The youths could establish that in spite of differences due to religion, caste, language or status they could live together and be friendly to one another, bringing forth living meaning to the spirit of “Unity in Diversity”. After their experience in the NYP camps the youths themselves felt that their life became more meaningful when they participated in nation building activities. NYP has been conducting about 10 camps in a year. They are : National Integration Camps, Communal Harmony Camps Literacy Camps, Relief Camps for victims of riots, earthquake etc. Women’s camps, Camps for Management Course, South East Asia Friendship Camp.</p>
